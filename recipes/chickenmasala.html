    <p>This is a really good recipe for spicy Indian chicken curry. It's pretty easy to make and tastes better than takeout!</p>
    
    <li>
        <ul>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>half cup cooking oil</ul>
        <ul>1 and half cups chopped onion</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon minced garlic</ul>
        <ul>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon curry powder</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground coriander</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon water</ul>
        <ul>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>1 cup plain yogurt</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>½ cup water</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon garam masala</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</ul>
     </li>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>
            <ol> Gather all ingredients.</ol>
            <ol>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</ol>
            <ol>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</ol>
            <ol>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</ol>
            <ol>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</ol>
            <ol>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</ol>
